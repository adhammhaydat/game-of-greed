## Description
***[Tell me about your application, should be about a paragraph]***
This is a console application, which resembles a popular game called Dice 10000, where the user starts by rolling 6 dices, and based on the rules of the game, they get to either bank the dices that evaluate to some value, of they do not, they can roll the remaining dices again, so that they might get to achieve a better score, but if the new roll does not evaluate to anything, the game is said to frackle, and the user's turn ends. If the user reaches 10000 they win.
