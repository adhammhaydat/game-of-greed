## Description

**_[Tell me about your application, should be about a paragraph]_**
This is a console application, which resembles a popular game called Dice 10000, where the user starts by rolling 6 dices, and based on the rules of the game, they get to either bank the dices that evaluate to some value, of they do not, they can roll the remaining dices again, so that they might get to achieve a better score, but if the new roll does not evaluate to anything, the game is said to frackle, and the user's turn ends. If the user reaches 10000 they win.

### Change Log

- 1.1: The basic logic of the fame is established, this included adding classes for handling rolling the dice, calculating the shelved value and handling the shelving and banking of the balance.
- 1.2: Added the feature of allowing the user to shelf points, and bank the points they chose. The game now will show the use the correct info like the number of the round, the amount shelved, and the amount banked, and the total balance. The user now can either quit midgame, or avoid playing at the first place by typing the correct key.
- 1.3: Added the get_scorers method, and extended the functionality of handling scoring all dices. Added the validate_keepers method nad now all tests pass.
